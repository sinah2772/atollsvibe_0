# Cache API Compatibility Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing errors related to the `caches` API:

```
CacheStore.js:18 Cache get failed: ReferenceError: caches is not defined
    at CacheStore.get (CacheStore.js:18:439)
    at CacheStore.getWithTTL (CacheStore.js:18:741)

    at async ShowOneChild.render (ShowOneChild.js:18:1961)
    at async ch-content-script-dend.js:18:90
```

This error indicates that a browser extension or third-party script is trying to use the `caches` API in a context where it's not available.

## Solution

We've implemented a comprehensive solution that:

1. **Provides a Cache API polyfill** - Creates a working implementation of the `caches` API when it's not available.

2. **Creates a robust CacheStore implementation** - Our own implementation that gracefully handles errors and falls back to alternatives when needed.

3. **Monitors for and patches browser extension errors** - Detects known problematic extensions and applies fixes to prevent them from breaking the app.

4. **Sets up global error handling** - Catches any related errors that weren't prevented by our polyfill.

## Files Added

1. **src/utils/cachePolyfill.js** - Basic Cache API polyfill that creates the `caches` global object if it doesn't exist.

2. **src/utils/CacheStore.js** - A robust cache implementation that works in all contexts with fallbacks.

3. **src/utils/cache.js** - Helper functions and exports for simplified cache usage.

4. **src/utils/setupCache.js** - Initializes the cache system and tests that it's working.

5. **src/utils/extensionCompat.js** - Detects and patches browser extensions that might cause problems.

## How It Works

1. The polyfill is loaded early in the application lifecycle (in main.tsx).
2. It checks if the `caches` API is available and creates a replacement if not.
3. Our cache implementation provides fallbacks to localStorage and memory storage.
4. The extension compatibility module patches known problematic extension methods.
5. Global error handling catches any errors that slip through.

## Benefits

- **Non-intrusive** - The solution doesn't require changes to existing code.
- **Robust** - Multiple layers of protection ensure the app keeps working.
- **Efficient** - Falls back to in-memory cache if needed, with minimal performance impact.

## Future Improvements

- If specific extensions continue to cause problems, we can add more targeted patches.
- Consider adding browser fingerprinting to detect which browsers or extensions are most problematic.
- Add telemetry to track when these fixes are being applied to understand the scope of the problem.
