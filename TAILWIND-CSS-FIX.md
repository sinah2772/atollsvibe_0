# Fixing Tailwind CSS Linting Issues

## Current Issue

Your VS Code is showing linting errors for Tailwind CSS directives like `@tailwind`, `@layer`, and `@apply` in your CSS files.

## Solutions Implemented

1. **Disabled CSS validation in VS Code settings:**
   - Created `.vscode/settings.json` to disable CSS validation
   - Added specific settings for CSS files

2. **Added Tailwind CSS-specific configuration:**
   - Added extension recommendations
   - Configured proper Tailwind CSS support

## How to Fix the Remaining Errors

These CSS warnings are just VS Code linting issues and don't affect how your application works. To get rid of them completely:

1. **Reload VS Code Window:**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
   - Type "Reload Window" and select it
   - This will restart VS Code with the new settings

2. **If Issues Persist:**
   - Install the VS Code Tailwind CSS Extension (already installed)
   - Set your CSS/SCSS file associations to PostCSS

These changes should resolve the linting issues without affecting the functionality of your Tailwind CSS setup.
